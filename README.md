# Dissociating semantic and action processing for animals and tools categories: A representational similarity analysis of behaviour data and fMRI data


To further understand how category knowledge is represented in the brain for different processing types and how we perceive objects similarity, we explore the neural and behavioural representations of semantic and action knowledge concerning animals and tools objects. This experiment was carried out by doing a multi-arrangement task for images similarity judgement and using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The two similarity representations were compared using the Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) method, by (Kriegeskorte et al 2008a, 2008b).
